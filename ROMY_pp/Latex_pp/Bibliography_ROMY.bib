abstract ={It has been noted by theoretical seismologists for decades that—in addition to translations and strains—the rotational part of ground motions should also be recorded. It is expected that collocated measurements of translations and rotations may (1) allow transformation of translational seismograms to the complete ground motion of an observation point; (2) help to further constrain rupture processes and (3) provide additional hazard-relevant information to earthquake engineers. The lack of instrumental sensitivity used to be the main obstacle to observing rotational motions. Recently, ring laser technology has provided the means to develop instruments that allow in principle the observation of rotational motions in a wide frequency band and epicentral distance range. Here we investigate whether this technology—originally designed for geodesy—is capable of providing accurate and useful observations for seismology. We report observations of rotations around a vertical axis of several earthquakes obtained by a 4 × 4 m ring laser installed in SE-Germany and compare them to collocated broad-band translations. Assuming plane transverse wave propagation, acceleration and rotation rate should be in phase and their amplitude ratio proportional to horizontal phase velocity. Here we show that most of the observations can be explained under these assumptions and that the collocated observations allow the estimation of wavefield properties (e.g. phase velocities, propagation directions), otherwise only accessible through seismic array measurements, polarization analysis, or additional strain measurements.},

abstract ={In addition to three classical components (vertical, north–south, and east–west) of ground translations recorded by a broadband seismometer, a component of earthquake induced rotational ground motions around the vertical axis is consistently measured by a ring laser sensor located in Wettzell, southeast Germany. Significant rotations around the vertical axis in the P coda of teleseismic signals are either directly visible or can be inferred through the investigation of cross correlation between the transverse component (the component that is perpendicular to the great circle connecting the earthquake and the seismometer) of translation acceleration and ring laser rotation rate. Theoretically, in spherically symmetric isotropic media, we should not observe rotational signals around the vertical axis before the onset of SH waves. Possible causes for the observed rotations in the P coda are: (1) tilt–ring laser coupling, (2) anisotropy, (3) topographic scattering, and (4) P-SH scattering in the crust. Here we show that P-SH scattering in the 3D random crust can explain the observations and allow us to constrain crustal scattering properties.},

Rotation dominates tilt and strain in modulating the Sagnac frequency, and microseisms are not significant. Power spectral densities for the ring laser and for the seismograph signals are enhanced in the 0.2- to 10-Hz range by up to 18 and 60 dB, respectively, over the noise floors (− 160 dB, or order nanoradians per second, and − 130 dB, respectively). A seismic sideband of the Earth rotation spectrum is found. These ring laser signals have magnitudes consistent with the amplitude of the standard seismograph record.},

In the Sagnac effect, this difference is proportional to the angular velocity. Present resolution is limited by thermal drifts in frequency pulling, itself reflecting mirror backscatter. The capability of ring lasers for measurements of geodesic interest, including seismometry and earth tides, and for detection of other sources of non-reciprocal refractive indices, including axions and CP violation, are discussed. In standard polarization geometries the observable is necessarily time-reversal odd. Scaling rules for dimensions, finesse etc summarizing past progress and suggesting future potential are given.}

abstract="In the past decade, a number of studies have reported the observation of rotational motion associated with seismic events. We report a first observation of rotational motion in the microseismic ambient noise band. A striking feature of rotational motion measurements is that the information about the seismic phase velocity and source back azimuth is contained in the amplitude ratio of a point measurement of rotation rate and transverse acceleration. We investigate the possibility of applying this method to ambient noise measured with a ring laser and a broadband seismometer at the Wettzell Geodetic Observatory in Germany. Using data in the secondary microseismic band, we recover local phase velocities as well as the back azimuth of the strongest noise source for two different time periods. In order to confirm these findings, we additionally compare the results with classical array processing techniques of the Gr{\"a}fenberg array located nearby.",

  abstract={The Python libraries NumPy and SciPy are extremely powerful tools for numerical processing and analysis well suited to a large variety of applications. We developed ObsPy ( http://obspy.org [http://obspy.org] ), a Python library for seismology intended to facilitate the development of seismological software packages and workflows, to utilize these abilities and provide a bridge for seismology into the larger scientific Python ecosystem. Scientists in many domains who wish to convert their existing tools and applications to take advantage of a platform like the one Python provides are confronted with several hurdles such as special file formats, unknown terminology, and no suitable replacement for a non-trivial piece of software. We present an approach to implement a domain-specific time series library on top of the scientific NumPy stack. In so doing, we show a realization of an abstract internal representation of time series data permitting I/O support for a diverse collection of file formats. Then we detail the integration and repurposing of well established legacy codes, enabling them to be used in modern workflows composed in Python. Finally we present a case study on how to integrate research code into ObsPy, opening it to the broader community. While the implementations presented in this work are specific to seismology, many of the described concepts and abstractions are directly applicable to other sciences, especially to those with an emphasis on time series analysis.}

Often a library is necessary that provides convenient access to data and allows easy control over all of the operations that are to be performed on the data. ObsPy is such a library, which is designed to access and process seismological waveform data and metadata. We use short and simple examples here to demonstrate how effective it is to use Python for seismological data analysis. Then, we illustrate the general capabilities of ObsPy, and highlight some of its specific aspects that are relevant for seismological data centers and observatories, through presentation of real-world examples.

  abstract={GINGER (Gyroscopes IN GEneral Relativity) is a proposal for measuring in a ground-based laboratory the Lense-Thirring effect, known also as inertial frame dragging, that is predicted by General Relativity, and is induced by the rotation of a massive source. GINGER will consist in an array of at least three square ring lasers, mutually orthogonal, with about 6-10 m side, and located in a deep underground site, possibly the INFN - National Laboratories of Gran Sasso. The tri-axial design will provide a complete estimation of the laboratory frame angular velocity, to be compared with the Earths rotation estimate provided by IERS with respect the fixed stars frame. Large-size ring lasers have already reached a very high sensitivity, allowing for relevant geodetic measurements. The accuracy required for Lense-Thirring effect measurement is higher than 10 -14 rad/s and therefore Earth angular velocity must be measured within one part in 10 -9 . A 3.6 m side, square ring laser, called GINGERino, has been recently installed inside the Gran Sasso underground laboratories in order to qualify the site for a future installation of GINGER. We discuss the current status of the experimental work, and in particular of the GINGERino prototype.}
